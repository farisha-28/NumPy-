NumPy Arrays
NumPy arrays are the main way we will use NumPy throughout the course. NumPy arrays essentially come in two flavors: vectors and matrices. Vectors are strictly 1-dimensional (1D) arrays and matrices are 2D (but you should note a matrix can still have only one row or one column).

Why we use Numpy array instead of a list?
There are lot's of reasons to use a Numpy array instead of a "standard" python list object. Our main reasons are:

Memory Efficiency of Numpy Array vs list
Easily expands to N-dimensional objects
Speed of calculations of numpy array
Broadcasting operations and functions with numpy
All the data science and machine learning libraries we use are built with Numpy

Here is solved some important examples using NumPy functions.
